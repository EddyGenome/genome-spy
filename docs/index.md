# Introduction

GenomeSpy is an interactive visualization tool for genomic data. It provides
a [grammar](grammar/index.md) for mapping data to visual channels (position,
color, etc.) and composing complex visualization from primitive graphical
marks (points, rectangles, etc.). The visualization is rendered using WebGL,
and thus, GenomeSpy is able to provide fluid interactions and smooth
animations for datasets as large as a few million data points.

To facilitate data exploration and comparison of multiple samples, GenomeSpy
supports [faceted](grammar/facet.md) visualizations and allows the user to
filter and sort samples interactively.

# Example

TODO: A simple example with some sensible data, preferably genomic data.
