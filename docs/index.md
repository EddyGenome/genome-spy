# Introduction

GenomeSpy is an interactive visualization tool for genomic data. It provides
a grammar for mapping data to various visual channels (position, color, etc.)
and composing complex visualization from primitive graphical marks (points,
rectangles, etc.). The visualization is rendered using WebGL and thus,
GenomeSpy is able to provide fluid interactions and smooth animations for
datasets as large as a few million data points.

To facilitate data exploration and comparison of multiple samples, GenomeSpy
supports faceted visualizations and allows the user to filter and sort samples
interactively.
