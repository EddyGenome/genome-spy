title: The Grammar of Graphics
---

The visualization grammar of GenomeSpy is a subset and a dialect of
[Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/). However, the goals of
GenomeSpy and Vega-Lite are different â€“ GenomeSpy is more domain-specific and
is intended for visualizing genomic coordinates. In its current form, the
grammar of GenomeSpy is limited to specifying visual encoding and certain data
transformations. GenomeSpy tries to faithfully follow Vega-Lite's grammar
where practical. Thus, this documentation has many references to Vega-Lite's
documentation.
