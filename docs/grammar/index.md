# A Grammar of Graphics

TODO: A short introduction to graphical grammars. Cite ggplot2 and Vega-Lite.

!!! note "A subset of Vega-Lite"

    The visualization grammar of GenomeSpy is a subset and a dialect of
    [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/). However, the goals of
    GenomeSpy and Vega-Lite are different â€“ GenomeSpy is more domain-specific
    and is intended for visualizing genomic coordinates. In its current form,
    the grammar of GenomeSpy is limited to specifying the visual encoding and
    certain data transformations. GenomeSpy tries to faithfully follow
    Vega-Lite's grammar where practical. Thus, this documentation has many
    references to its documentation.
